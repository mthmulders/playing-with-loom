# Playing with Loom
Some sample code to accompany my blog post "[Playing with Loom](https://maarten.mulders.it/2022/03/playing-with-loom/)".

## Disclaimer
The code in this repo is NOT production grade and lacks any automated testing.
I intentionally kept it as simple as possible (KISS).
Its primary purpose is demonstrating several some concepts from Loom and not being a full-fledged application that can be put into production as is.

You can in no way hold me liable for damage caused directly or indirectly by using this code.
